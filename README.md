This is the code for my personal website it was created in JavaScript, HTML, CSS!

I am more focused on backend engineering so I tried to keep it as simple as possible using just basic html, css and javascript with a bootstrap for the top bar, cards, and styling.

If you would like to contact me, please do so!
